  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>April 4, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The difference between arrays and hashes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays consists of elements, each in a slot, lined up from 0 to n. Example: 
      array[0] = a 
      array [1] = b
      array [2] = c
      Result: 
      (a, b, c) is an array of 3 elements, with a in the 0th slot and c in the 2nd slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes are similar to arrays. They have slots pointing to various objects. However, the slots aren't in a row and are not numbered. Any slot can be referred to by any object. Example: 
      hash[apple] = x 
      hash[orange] = y 
      hash[banana] = z
      Result:
      (x, y, z) is a hash of 3 elements, with x being designated as an object 'apple'.
