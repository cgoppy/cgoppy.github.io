      The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding is often difficult to decipher. Many students get caught up in the subtleties. The following <a href="http://codepen.io/carolineartz/full/ogVXZj/"> LINK </a>  helps to illustrate the differences between the elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is helpful to start with the <b>Content</b>. Envision a <i>square box</i>. Your content is the innermost space. It is where you put the words of a blog entry for example.
    </p>
      The next element is the <b>Padding</b>. This is the space surrounding your content. It extends from the content to the edge of the <i>square box</i>.
    <p>
      The subsequent element is the <b>Border</b>. This is the actual lines forming your <i>square box</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, there is the <b>Margin</b>. This is the outermost space. This extends outside of your <i>square box</i> to the edge of the page. There is no other content on your website beyound the Margin.
