      In this blog entry, I will explain the enumerable method '.map'
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, an enumerable method operates on each and every element of the set. The enumerator changes the set into a new set based on the conditions set by the enumeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Enumerable#map operation, one generally uses such operation on an array. When one wants to return a a new array after running a set enumeration on each element of the array.  
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, consider the enumeration contained in the ruby documentation:
      (1..4).map{|i| i*i}
      This results in each element from 1 to 4 being piped into a 'i' variable. Each 'i' then gets multipled by itself. The map method then returns the result of such multiplication to a new array:
      (1, 4, 9, 16)
    </p>
