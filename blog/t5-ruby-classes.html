    <p>
      Ruby Classes are an important tool.  Most importantly, they allow batch edits and changes to objects within the Class. They are simple to use and a pleasure to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
       As an example, I will create a class and include instance variables and instance methods for this object. I will also allow batch edits to the class. The following allows the venue/date of the MLB game to be changed and inputted, and prints the schedule for the user to see. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>Example</u>
          Class MLB
          def initialize (venue, date)  #example of an instance method
          @venue = venue
          @date = date #example of instance variables
          end
          def venue
          @venue
          end
          def date
          @date
          end
          def printout
          puts “The MLB game is for the #{date} taking place at: #{venue}”
          end
          end 

          e1 = MLB.new(“Yankees Stadium”, “April 19, 2015”)
          e1.printout

          "The MLB game is for April 19, 2015 taking place at: Yankees"
