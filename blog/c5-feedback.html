  <h2>Proper Feedback</h2>

      ASK (Actionable, Specific, Kind) feedback is kind in that it is phrased to respect the receiver. It is actionable in that it formulates a concrete plan of action. Finally, it is specific in that it is narrowly tailored to one aspect, and does not attempt to address everything.

      The majority of feedback at Devbootcamp is positive.  Based on the Student and Guided feedbacks, people are able to discover their strengths and weaknesses. To improve, one should continue asking questions for things they do not understand.

      At the same time, some feedback maybe overly positive. Rather than try to shade the truth, DBC Students should be more honest with their opinions.

      As a personal aside, I felt frustrated with one Pairing session in particular. My Partner kept mixing up the Driver/Navigator roles. This led to general confusion as I lost kept of the Code that I wrote during the session. Therefore, making my concerns clear to that person through ASK Feedback would help them improve.
