Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
</p>

<p>
I believe the DBC experience would inspire a proactive learning approach to programming. I hope to engage in the DBC culture through taking the “Kitchen” approach. I will see myself as a contributor to my experience and not a passive consumer. To achieve this experience, I hope to engage with the materials and work collaboratively with my Peers. There will be both beginners and advanced programmers at the inception of DBC. However, all types of Students will be in the same journey towards becoming computer engineers.  Therefore, a dynamic learning environment fostering safety and support would produce viable “world class beginners.”
