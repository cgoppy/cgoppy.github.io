  <h2>Problems Facing Tech World</h2>

      There are many problems facing the tech world. These problems range from gender disparity to budgetary shortfalls. For this blog entry, I have decided that the most pressing problem is the issue of Multinational Operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem arises when one company has multiple offices and data centers in multiple countries, around the world. The biggest challenge to overcome is the difference between salaries of employees of the same Company but in different Countries.

    <p>
      Often, emotions run high when one has been affected by outsourcing. Salary differences can breed resentment. Although slightly alleviated by differences in standard of living costs, it seems patently unfair for two identical workers to receive different salaries.

    <p>
      One potential solution can be to change the "us versus them" mindset. In the increasingly interconnected and globalized world, nation boundaries are a minor inconvenience in the quest for advancement and achievement. A Company must foster a meritocratic system; treating all of its workers equally.     
    </p>
    <p>
      Only through following the principal of equality can one truly incentivize human potential.
